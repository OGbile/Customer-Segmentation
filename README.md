# Customer-Segmentation 
The dataset comprises non-verbal preference assessment of tourists who are clients of the Sol Cayo Guillermo hotel belonging to the Melia hotel chain, in Jardines del Rey, Cuba. Then, by applying computational intelligence algorithms to this dataset, I divide customers into segments 
according to their non-verbal preferences

Data Set Information:

A total of 73 customers, aged between 24 and 81 years old, were surveyed. Of the customers surveyed, 38 were returning customers, and 35 were new cus-tomers. The variables chosen are the essential ones that make up the non-verbal communication system. In addition to being the most feasible to evaluate in clients. The non-verbal system is made up of subsystems such as kinesic, paralanguage, proxemic, chronic, and others. In the design of the questionnaire, the indicators that make up these subsystems were taken into account to be explored as part of the client's communication preferences, as well as being feasible to evaluate in clients. The 22 variables analyzed were considered feasible to evaluate by the hotel's clientele.
